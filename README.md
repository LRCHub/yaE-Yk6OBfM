[00:21.47] Rage from the mountain blisters
[00:25.61] Like the stone beneath my feet
[00:28.87] Where the demons fester
[00:31.23] And pray for our defeat
[00:42.73] 
[00:33.57] I see smoke on the hot wind shimmer
[00:38.26] Souls unrestrained, in desperate need
[00:42.12] Of a final hellfire
[00:44.50] To burn the past and set them free
[01:01.50] 
[00:48.33] Through the fear, through the heart that's broken
[00:51.52] Our world lies in wait for me
[00:54.88] Every tear, every scar left open
[00:58.12] This is the taming of the beast
[01:01.14] I'll end this war you started
[01:04.64] I'll stitch this wound with bloodshed
[01:08.04] You are my wicked victory
[01:29.09] Draw me to the light
[01:31.90] Let the curse be lifted
[01:35.30] We can rise above the roar
[01:38.67] With the bite of every devil we've felled before
[02:02.67] 
[01:43.07] Drown them out
[01:45.24] Let the fog give way to clarity
[01:47.84] There is power in the strain of every drop I bleed
[01:51.05] I am the venom and the cure
[01:56.42] Take me
[01:59.92] 
[01:57.77] Through the fear, through the heart that's broken
[02:01.18] Our world lies in wait for me
[02:04.21] Every tear, every scar left open
[02:07.65] This is the taming of the beast
[02:10.81] I'll end this war you started
[02:14.18] I'll stitch this wound with bloodshed
[02:17.66] You are my wicked victory (Victory)
[02:30.47] (Burn)
[02:50.08] Skies stained red
[02:53.63] Pain subsides
[02:56.70] Sins unpunished
[02:59.83] Made pure beneath the knife
[03:13.33] 
[03:03.61] Cleanse and suture
[03:06.53] The great divide
[03:09.74] We seal our future
[03:12.65] In a blaze of white
[03:22.15] 
[03:17.05] Through the fear, through the heart that's broken
[03:21.61] (Lies in wait for me)
[03:23.77] Every tear, every scar left open
[03:26.79] This is the taming of the beast
[03:29.97] I'll end this war you started (You started)
[03:33.59] I'll stitch this wound with bloodshed (With bloodshed)
[03:37.17] You are my wicked victory
